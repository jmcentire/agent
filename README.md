# Agent - AI-Powered Shell Assistant

## ⚠️ EXTREME DANGER WARNING ⚠️

**THIS SCRIPT EXECUTES ARBITRARY LINUX COMMANDS GENERATED BY AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (OpenAI API). USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

* **HIGH RISK:** The AI might generate unexpected, incorrect, or malicious commands.
* **DATA LOSS:** Executing commands could lead to accidental deletion or modification of files and system settings.
* **SYSTEM DAMAGE:** Improper commands could potentially damage your operating system or configuration.
* **SECURITY VULNERABILITY:** Generated commands might inadvertently expose sensitive information or create security holes.
* **UNINTENDED COSTS:** Each command execution involves calls to the OpenAI API, which may incur costs depending on your usage and plan.

**DO NOT run this script:**
* On systems with sensitive data.
* In production environments.
* With elevated privileges (root/sudo) unless you fully understand the implications and risks of the specific command being generated.

**You are solely responsible for any consequences resulting from the execution of commands generated by this script.** It is highly recommended to review the generated command (in debug mode) *before* relying on its output, although the current script executes immediately.

## Description

`agent` is an experimental, interactive Bash shell assistant that leverages the OpenAI API (specifically models like GPT-4 Turbo) to interpret natural language goals and translate them into Linux commands. It then **directly executes** these generated commands and displays their output.

The goal is to provide a conversational way to perform command-line tasks, but its power comes with significant risks due to the direct execution model.

## Features

* Interactive shell interface (`agent:` prompt).
* Natural language goal interpretation via OpenAI API.
* Direct execution of generated Linux commands.
* Toggleable Debug/Verbose mode for detailed logging.
    * Start with `-v`, `--verbose`, or `--debug=on`.
    * Toggle interactively with `set debug=on` / `set debug=off`.
* Session logging to a timestamped file (`agent_shell_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`).

## Prerequisites

Before running `agent`, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Linux Environment:** A standard Linux system with `bash`.
2.  **`curl`:** The command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`).
3.  **`jq`:** A lightweight command-line JSON processor. Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`).
4.  **OpenAI API Key:** You need an API key from OpenAI. Obtain one at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
5.  **OpenAI Account:** Your OpenAI account must be set up for API usage (which may involve setting up billing).

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Get the Script:**
    * Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
    * OR save the script code directly into a file named `agent`.

2.  **Make Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x agent
    ```

3.  **Set API Key:**
    The script expects your OpenAI API key to be available in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can set it temporarily for your current session:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    For persistent use (use with caution, consider security implications), add the `export` line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) and restart your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

## Usage

1.  **Start the Agent:**
    Navigate to the directory containing the `agent` script and run:
    ```bash
    ./agent [options]
    ```

2.  **Command-Line Options:**
    * `./agent` : Starts in default (quiet) mode.
    * `./agent -v` : Starts in verbose/debug mode.
    * `./agent --verbose` : Starts in verbose/debug mode.
    * `./agent --debug=on` : Starts in verbose/debug mode.
    * `./agent --debug=off`: Starts explicitly in quiet mode (overrides other flags if used last).

3.  **Interactive Shell:**
    You will see the `agent:` prompt. Type your goal in natural language and press Enter.
    *Example Goals:*
    ```
    agent: list all files including hidden ones sorted by size
    agent: show my current public IP address
    agent: find all .log files in /var/log modified in the last hour
    agent: count the number of lines in README.md
    ```
    The script will attempt to generate and execute the corresponding command, then display the output.

4.  **Toggling Debug Mode:**
    While the agent is running:
    * Type `set debug=on` to enable verbose output for subsequent commands.
    * Type `set debug=off` to disable verbose output.

5.  **Exiting:**
    Type `exit`, `quit`, or press `Ctrl+D` to terminate the agent shell.

## Configuration

* **API Key:** Set via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (required).
* **AI Model:** The OpenAI model used can be changed by modifying the `MODEL` variable near the top of the `agent` script file (default: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`). Ensure the chosen model is compatible with the Chat Completions API endpoint.
